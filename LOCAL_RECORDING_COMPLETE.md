# Local Audio Recording - Implementation Complete âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Fixed Dev Server Crash âœ…

**Problem**: Node.js network interface error on macOS causing server to crash
**Solution**:

- Updated `package.json` to use `--hostname localhost` flag
- This bypasses the faulty network interface detection

**Files Modified**:

- `package.json` - Added `--hostname localhost` to dev script
- `next.config.ts` - Added experimental config for larger file uploads (10MB)

### 2. Browser-Based Audio Recording âœ…

**Implementation**: Created `AudioRecorder` class using MediaRecorder API

**Features**:

- Records audio in WebM format (native browser support)
- Auto-starts when call begins
- Auto-stops and uploads when call ends
- No Daily.co subscription required!

**Files Created**:

- `lib/audio-recorder.ts` - Audio recording class with start/stop methods

### 3. Upload & Processing Pipeline âœ…

**Flow**: Record â†’ Upload â†’ Transcribe â†’ Summarize

**Implementation**:

1. Audio recorded locally in browser
2. Uploaded to Supabase Storage on call end
3. Recording record created in database
4. Transcription Edge Function triggered automatically
5. Summary Edge Function triggered after transcription completes

**Files Created**:

- `app/api/sessions/[id]/upload-recording/route.ts` - Handles blob upload

### 4. Enhanced Video Call UI âœ…

**Improvements**:

- Redesigned controls with better visibility
- Added text labels to all buttons
- Red "End Call" button (more prominent)
- Recording status with duration counter
- Better contrast and backdrop blur
- Works in both normal and full-screen modes

**Files Modified**:

- `components/sessions/video-call.tsx` - Complete UI overhaul

## How It Works

### Recording Flow

```
1. User clicks "Start Video Call"
   â†“
2. Browser requests microphone permission
   â†“
3. Call joins â†’ Audio recording starts automatically
   â†“
4. Recording indicator shows to both users (transparent)
   â†“
5. Duration counter updates in real-time
   â†“
6. User clicks "End Call"
   â†“
7. Recording stops â†’ Audio blob created
   â†“
8. Blob uploaded to Supabase Storage
   â†“
9. Database record created
   â†“
10. Transcription Edge Function triggered
    â†“
11. (After transcription) Summary Edge Function triggered
    â†“
12. User sees transcript & summary in session page
```

### Technical Details

**Audio Format**: WebM (audio/webm)

- Native to MediaRecorder API
- Excellent compression
- Supported by all modern browsers
- Compatible with Groq Whisper API

**Storage Location**: Supabase Storage bucket `audio-recordings`

- Path: `{user_id}/{session_id}/{filename}.webm`
- Example: `abc123/def456/1734567890.webm`

**Processing**: Runs on Supabase Edge Functions (independent of Next.js app)

- Transcription: Uses Groq Whisper Large v3
- Summary: Uses Groq LLaMA 3.1 70B
- Both run automatically in sequence

## UI Changes

### Control Bar (Before)

- Small buttons without labels
- Hard to see on video background
- End Call button not prominent

### Control Bar (After)

- Large buttons with text labels
- Backdrop blur for better visibility
- Red "End Call" button stands out
- Recording status with timer
- Works in full screen mode

### Recording Indicator

- Shows "Recording" badge in top-right corner
- Visible to both therapist and client
- Red pulsing dot animation
- Duration counter in control bar

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality

- [x] Dev server starts without errors
- [x] Buttons are clearly visible
- [x] End Call button is red
- [ ] Audio recording starts automatically
- [ ] Recording indicator shows
- [ ] Duration counter increments
- [ ] Recording stops on call end
- [ ] Audio uploads successfully
- [ ] Transcription triggers
- [ ] Summary generates

### What to Test

1. **Start a video call**:

   - Go to a session
   - Click "Start Video Call"
   - Allow camera/microphone permissions
   - Verify call connects

2. **Check recording**:

   - Look for red "Recording" badge in top-right
   - Verify duration counter is incrementing
   - Speak into microphone for 30+ seconds

3. **Check UI**:

   - Are buttons visible and large?
   - Is End Call button red?
   - Do Video/Audio buttons work?
   - Does full-screen work?

4. **End call**:

   - Click red "End Call" button
   - Watch for "Uploading recording..." toast
   - Should see "Recording uploaded! Transcription started."

5. **Check processing**:
   - Go back to session page
   - Refresh if needed
   - Should see "Transcribing audio..." message
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for transcript to appear
   - Wait another minute for summary to appear

## Troubleshooting

### Dev Server Won't Start

**Error**: `uv_interface_addresses returned Unknown system error 1`
**Fix**: Already implemented - using `--hostname localhost` flag

### Recording Not Starting

**Error**: `Failed to start audio recording`
**Check**:

1. Browser permissions granted?
2. Console logs show errors?
3. Try different browser

### Upload Fails

**Error**: `Failed to upload recording`
**Check**:

1. Supabase Storage bucket exists (`audio-recordings`)
2. Bucket is public or has proper RLS policies
3. File size under 10MB (should be fine for audio)

### Transcription Not Starting

**Check**:

1. Edge Function deployed (`transcribe-recording`)
2. `GROQ_API_KEY` set in Supabase Dashboard
3. Check Edge Function logs in Supabase Dashboard

### No Transcript Appears

**Check**:

1. Wait 2-3 minutes (transcription takes time)
2. Refresh the session page
3. Check recording status in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM recordings WHERE session_id = '<session-id>';
   ```
4. Check `transcript_status` field (should be "completed")

## API Routes

### Upload Recording

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/sessions/[id]/upload-recording`

**Request**:

```typescript
FormData {
  audio: Blob (audio/webm)
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "recordingId": "uuid",
  "message": "Recording uploaded successfully. Transcription started."
}
```

### Edge Functions (Already Deployed)

1. **transcribe-recording**

   - Triggered automatically after upload
   - Downloads audio from Storage
   - Transcribes using Groq Whisper
   - Updates database with transcript

2. **generate-summary**
   - Triggered automatically after transcription
   - Uses transcript from database
   - Generates summary using Groq LLaMA
   - Updates database with summary

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow** (most important!)
2. Consider adding:

   - Manual record button (optional override)
   - Pause/resume recording (advanced)
   - Download recording from UI
   - Edit transcript inline
   - Regenerate summary

3. **Production considerations**:
   - Monitor storage usage (audio files can be large)
   - Set up automatic cleanup of old recordings
   - Consider audio compression before upload
   - Add error retry logic for failed uploads

## File Summary

**New Files**:

- `lib/audio-recorder.ts` - Audio recording logic
- `app/api/sessions/[id]/upload-recording/route.ts` - Upload handler
- `LOCAL_RECORDING_COMPLETE.md` - This file

**Modified Files**:

- `components/sessions/video-call.tsx` - Integrated recording + UI improvements

- `next.config.ts` - Increased upload size limit

## Success Criteria

âœ… Dev server runs without network errors

âœ… Upload pipeline created
âœ… UI improved for better visibility
âœ… End Call button is red and prominent
âœ… Recording indicator visible to all
âœ… Integrates with existing Edge Functions

ðŸ”„ **Pending**: Full end-to-end testing with real call

## Commands

### Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Check if Recording Exists

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM recordings ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Edge Function Logs

```bash
# Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ [function name] â†’ Logs
```

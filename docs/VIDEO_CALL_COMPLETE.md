# ✅ Video Call Complete & Client Join Flow

## 🎉 What's Been Fixed

### 1. ✅ Video Display (No More Black Screen!)

- **Problem**: Black screen when joining call
- **Solution**: Properly implemented Daily.co hooks (`useParticipantIds`, `useVideoTrack`, `useAudioTrack`)
- **Now shows**: Your camera feed + all participants

### 2. ✅ Full Screen Mode

- **Feature**: Click maximize button (top-left) to go full screen
- **Auto Full Screen**: Clients automatically get full screen view
- **Toggle**: Click again to exit full screen

### 3. ✅ Client Join Flow

- **Problem**: Clients couldn't join (needed authentication)
- **Solution**: Created public join page at `/join/[sessionId]`
- **Features**:
  - ✅ No authentication required
  - ✅ Simple name entry
  - ✅ Direct join to session
  - ✅ Full screen video experience

# ✅ Controls should appear (mic, video, end call)
# ✅ Maximize button in top-left corner
```

### Test 2: Client View (Same Computer)

```bash
# 1. Copy the client join link from therapist view
# Example: http://localhost:3000/join/[session-id]

# - Start video call
# - Copy client link

# Device 2 (Phone/tablet - Client):
# - Make sure on same WiFi network
# - Go to: http://[your-local-ip]:3000/join/[session-id]
#   (Replace [your-local-ip] with your computer's IP, e.g., http://192.168.1.100:3000/join/...)
# - Enter name and join

# ✅ You should see each other!
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **`components/sessions/video-call.tsx`** - Fixed video display

   - Added `VideoTile` component for each participant
   - Used proper Daily.co hooks
   - Added full screen toggle

2. **`app/join/[sessionId]/page.tsx`** - NEW: Public join page

   - No authentication required
   - Name entry for clients
   - Full screen video experience

3. **`app/api/sessions/[id]/room-url/route.ts`** - NEW: API endpoint

   - Returns room URL for public access
   - Validates session is active

4. **`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/sessions/[id]/page.tsx`** - Updated
   - Added client join link display
   - Copy to clipboard functionality
   - Shows link when call is active

### How Video Rendering Works:

```typescript
// Old (broken) ❌
<DailyVideo />; // Generic, doesn't show participants properly

// New (working) ✅
{
  participantIds.map((id) => (
    <VideoTile sessionId={id} /> // Individual tiles for each participant
  ));
}
```

The `VideoTile` component:

- Uses `useVideoTrack(sessionId)` to get video stream
- Uses `useAudioTrack(sessionId)` to get audio
- Renders actual `<video>` element with `srcObject`
- Shows avatar fallback if camera is off

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Black Screen Issues:

✅ **FIXED** - This is now resolved!

If you still see black screen:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure camera permissions are granted
3. Try different browser (Chrome/Firefox work best)
4. Check Daily.co room is created (check network tab)

### Client Can't Join:

1. Make sure video call is started first
2. Check link is correct (should start with `/join/`)
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Check session status is "in_progress"

### Camera Not Working:

1. Grant camera/microphone permissions
2. Close other apps using camera (Zoom, etc.)
3. Try different browser
4. Check browser settings

### Can't See Other Person:

1. Make sure both joined same room
2. Check network connection
3. Look in browser console for errors
4. Try refreshing page

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Room Privacy:

- Rooms are set to `"public"` for ease of use
- Room URLs are unique and hard to guess
- Rooms expire after 2 hours
- Only people with link can join

### Future Enhancement (Optional):

If you want more security, implement:

1. Meeting tokens for private rooms
2. Waiting room for clients
3. Host approval before joining
4. Password-protected sessions

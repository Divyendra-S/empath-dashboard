# Database Setup Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

All database tables and storage have been successfully created in your Supabase project!

### Created Tables

1. **profiles** - Therapist profiles (extends auth.users)

   - Columns: id, full_name, email, avatar_url, created_at, updated_at
   - RLS: ✅ Enabled
   - Policies: Users can view/update/insert their own profile

2. **clients** - Client information

   - Columns: id, therapist_id, full_name, email, phone, date_of_birth, notes, status, created_at, updated_at
   - RLS: ✅ Enabled
   - Policies: Therapists can CRUD their own clients only
   - Indexes: therapist_id, status

3. **sessions** - Session scheduling and metadata

   - Columns: id, therapist_id, client_id, scheduled_at, duration_minutes, status, notes, call_type, daily_room_url, daily_room_name, meeting_url, created_at, updated_at
   - RLS: ✅ Enabled
   - Policies: Therapists can CRUD their own sessions only
   - Indexes: therapist_id, client_id, scheduled_at, status, call_type

4. **recordings** - Audio files and transcripts
   - Columns: id, session_id, file_path, file_size_bytes, duration_seconds, transcript, transcript_status, created_at
   - RLS: ✅ Enabled
   - Policies: Therapists can CRUD recordings for their own sessions only
   - Indexes: session_id, transcript_status

### Storage Bucket

- **audio-recordings** - Private bucket for session recordings
  - Public: No (private)
  - RLS Policies: ✅ Configured
  - Therapists can upload/view/update/delete only their own recordings
  - File path structure: `{user_id}/{session_id}/{filename}`

### Migrations Applied

1. ✅ `initial_schema` - Created all tables with indexes
2. ✅ `enable_rls_policies` - Enabled RLS and created all security policies
3. ✅ `storage_policies` - Created storage bucket and RLS policies
4. ✅ `fix_function_search_path` - Fixed security warning for trigger function

### Features Implemented

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All tables have RLS enabled, ensuring data isolation
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper relationships between tables
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization on frequently queried columns
- **Triggers**: Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- **Check Constraints**: Data validation for status fields
- **Storage Security**: Private bucket with user-scoped access control

## Security Status

✅ **No security warnings** - All security advisors pass

## Next Steps

Now that your database is set up, you can proceed with:

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation & Authentication

   - Set up Supabase client utilities
   - Build authentication pages (login, signup)
   - Implement protected routes middleware
   - Create basic dashboard layout

2. **Environment Variables**
   Add these to your `.env.local`:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   DAILY_API_KEY=your-daily-api-key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
   ```

3. **Test Database Connection**
   Create a simple test to verify Supabase client works:
   ```typescript
   // Test in your Next.js app
   import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client";
   const supabase = createClient();
   const { data, error } = await supabase.from("profiles").select("*");
   ```

## Database Schema Reference

### Table Relationships

```
auth.users (Supabase Auth)
    ↓
profiles (1:1 with auth.users)
    ↓
clients (many:1 with profiles via therapist_id)
    ↓
sessions (many:1 with clients)
    ↓
recordings (many:1 with sessions)
```

### Status Values

**clients.status:**

- `active` - Active client
- `archived` - Archived/inactive client

**sessions.status:**

- `scheduled` - Session scheduled
- `in_progress` - Session currently happening
- `completed` - Session finished
- `cancelled` - Session cancelled

**sessions.call_type:**

- `internal` - Built-in Daily.co video call
- `external_link` - External Zoom/Meet link
- `local_recording` - Manual local recording

**recordings.transcript_status:**

- `pending` - Waiting to be transcribed
- `processing` - Currently being transcribed
- `completed` - Transcription complete
- `failed` - Transcription failed

## Quick Database Queries

### Count all records

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles) as profiles,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients) as clients,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions) as sessions,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recordings) as recordings;
```

### View all policies

```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

### Check RLS status

```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

# Summary Markdown Formatting Fix

## Issue

The AI-generated summary was displaying as **plain text** instead of properly formatted markdown:

### Before (Plain Text):

```
## Session Summary

### Brief Overview
The client initiated the session but didn't provide a meaningful update...

### Key Themes Discussed
No significant themes were discussed...
```

All headers and text appeared as one continuous block without formatting.

---

## Solution

Installed `react-markdown` library and updated the `SessionSummary` component to render markdown with custom styling.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install react-markdown remark-gfm --save
```

- **react-markdown**: Renders markdown content in React
- **remark-gfm**: Adds support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, strikethrough, etc.)

#### 2. Updated Component

**File**: `components/sessions/session-summary.tsx`

**Changes**:

1. Added imports:

   ```typescript
   import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";
   import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";
   ```

2. Replaced plain text rendering with ReactMarkdown:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   <div className="whitespace-pre-wrap text-slate-700">{summary}</div>

   // After
   <ReactMarkdown
     remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}
     components={{...}}
   >
     {summary}
   </ReactMarkdown>
   ```

## Custom Markdown Styling

The component now renders markdown with beautiful, therapy-focused styling:

| Element           | Styling                                   | Purpose                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **H1**            | `text-xl font-bold text-purple-900`       | Main title             |
| **H2**            | `text-lg font-bold text-purple-800`       | Section headers        |
| **H3**            | `text-base font-semibold text-purple-700` | Subsection headers     |
| **Paragraphs**    | `mb-3 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed`     | Body text with spacing |
| **Lists (ul/ol)** | `list-disc/decimal list-inside space-y-1` | Bullet/numbered lists  |
| **Bold**          | `font-semibold text-purple-900`           | Emphasized text        |
| **Italic**        | `italic text-slate-600`                   | Subtle emphasis        |

## Result

### After (Formatted Markdown):

The summary now displays as:

<div style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #faf5ff, #fce7f3); padding: 20px; border-radius: 12px;">

# Session Summary

### Brief Overview

The client initiated the session but didn't provide a meaningful update on their day. The conversation started but was cut off abruptly.

### Key Themes Discussed

No significant themes were discussed due to the abrupt end of the conversation.

### Client's Emotional State and Progress

It's challenging to assess the client's emotional state or progress due to the lack of substantial discussion.

### Action Items or Homework Assigned

No action items or homework were assigned.

### Important Insights or Breakthroughs

No insights or breakthroughs were achieved during this session.

Given the abrupt nature of the conversation's end, it might be beneficial to explore what happened and how to re-engage the client in the next session.
